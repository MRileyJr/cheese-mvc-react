## Declarative Cycling

The declarative cycling approach can be applied to any type of development. In frontend design it has the following cycle. Remember that this is just a general cycle to keep you on track. You do not need to follow it strictly if doing so impinges on your development flow:

- **Level** entry point
  - begin at the highest (macro) point of the current level
  - your application, the Route Component(s)
  - a Parent component
  - a Child component
- **Declare** (without implementing) the pieces needed to fulfill that level
  - in this step you are simply "shelling" out the pieces you need
    - none (or some) of it exists
    - you are providing some basic framing to be filled out during implementation
  - this is a first pass, you don't need to get it perfect just be fluid and declare what you think you will need at the moment
    - you can (and will) return to flesh out or make changes during the **Implementation** or **Loop** step of the cycle
  - Route Component
    - its path
    - its behavior
    - the name of the Component it will render
      - create a file with this name
      - write its `import` statement
  - Component (whichever apply)
    - consider its responsibilities
      - does it need to be a stateful component or can it be a functional component?
    - use functions
      - if they do not exist
        - call them as you would want them to behave
        - consider what arguments they would need
        - consider what they return / what behavior you expect them to perform
        - if the function is only used in this component
          - if it uses the component's state or methods define it as a method
          - if it does not then define it externally as a standalone utility function
        - if the function is shared
          - create the file and import it
    - its props
      - its name (defined in the Parent that renders the component)
      - how it is to be used
      - is it required (will the component break without this prop)?
      - should it have a default value?
    - its state
      - declarative names
      - initial values
    - its methods
      - its lifecycle or declarative name
      - its parameters
    - its rendering behavior
      - conditional rendering logic
      - HTML and/or Style Components
      - Child Components (whichever apply)
        - its declarative name
          - create the file with this name and import it
            - the component is specific to this Parent
              - create it in a sub-directory specific to the Parent
            - the component is generic and may be reused across multiple Parents
              - create it in a shared directory
        - its event props
        - its HTML attribute props
        - its data props from the Parent
        - its handler methods from the Parent
- **Implement** the pieces needed to fulfill the level (whichever apply)
  - implement the pieces you are certain of
    - prop types
    - default props
    - method bodies
    - conditional rendering logic
  - skip pieces you are unsure of at the time and return at a later **Loop** step
- **Loop**
  - to the first step on the next level
    - if this level appears complete at the moment
      - implement tests
      - go one level down
    - if this level and all of its sublevels are complete
      - move horizontally to another piece at this level
      - if requirements are met and all tests pass you are done
  - to a step on the previous level
    - if new ideas have come to light that require changes
    - if you have a better understanding of how something you skipped should now be implemented
  - many choices of next level
    - choose the level that is most depended on by other pieces
